            <h2>Schizophrenia</h2>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>What is it?</h3>
            <p>Schizophrenia is a serious and lifelong neurodevelopmental disorder that affects how a person thinks, feels, and behaves.</p>
            <p>People with schizophrenia may experience delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech or behavior, and impaired cognitive ability. They may hear voices or see things that aren’t there. They may believe other people are reading their minds, controlling their thoughts, or plotting to harm them. These behaviors can be scary and upsetting to people with the illness and make them withdrawn or extremely agitated. It can also be scary and upsetting to the people around them.</p>
            <p>People with schizophrenia may sometimes talk about strange or unusual ideas, which can make it difficult to carry on a conversation. They may sit for hours without moving or talking. Sometimes people with schizophrenia seem perfectly fine until they talk about what they are thinking.</p>
            <p>Schizophrenia is not dissociative identity disorder (formerly called multiple personality disorder or split personality). While some of the signs may seem similar on the surface, people with dissociative identity disorder have two or more distinct identities that are present and alternately take control of them.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>Symptoms</h3>
            <p>It’s important to know the signs and symptoms of schizophrenia and seek help early. The signs usually appear between ages 16 and 30. In rare cases, children can have schizophrenia too. Schizophrenia symptoms fall into three categories: positive, negative, and cognitive.</p>
            <div>
                <h4>Positive symptoms</h4>
                <p>“Positive” symptoms are referred to as positive because the symptoms are additional behaviors not generally seen in healthy people. For some people, these symptoms come and go. For others, the symptoms become stable over time. These symptoms can be severe— but at other times—unnoticeable. Positive symptoms include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Hallucinations:</b> When a person sees, hears, smells, tastes, or feels things that are not real. Hearing voices is common for people with schizophrenia. People who hear voices may hear them for a long time before family or friends notice a problem.</li>
                    <li><b>Delusions:</b> When a person believes things that are not true. For example, a person may believe that people on the radio and television are talking directly to him or her. Sometimes people who have delusions may believe that they are in danger or that others are trying to hurt them.</li>
                    <li><b>Thought disorders:</b> When a person has ways of thinking that are odd or illogical. People with thought disorders may have trouble organizing their thoughts. Sometimes a person will stop talking in the middle of a thought or make up words that have no meaning.</li>
                    <li><b>Movement disorders:</b> When a person exhibits abnormal body movements. A person may repeat certain motions over and over—this is called stereotypies. At the other extreme, a person may stop moving or talking for a while, which is a rare condition called catatonia.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h4>Negative symptoms</h4>
                <p>“Negative” symptoms refer to social withdrawal, difficulty showing emotions, or difficulty functioning normally. People with negative symptoms may need help with everyday tasks. Negative symptoms include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Talking in a dull voice</li>
                    <li>Showing no facial expression, such as a smile or frown</li>
                    <li>Having trouble experiencing happiness</li>
                    <li>Having trouble planning and sticking with an activity, such as grocery shopping</li>
                    <li>Talking very little to other people, even when it is important</li>
                </ul>
                <p>These symptoms are harder to recognize as part of schizophrenia and can be mistaken for depression or other conditions.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h4>Cognitive symptoms</h4>
                <p>Cognitive symptoms are not easy to see, but they can make it hard for people to have a job or take care of themselves. The level of cognitive function is one of the best predictors of a person’s ability to improve how they function overall. Often, these symptoms are detected only when specific tests are performed. Cognitive symptoms include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Difficulty processing information to make decisions</li>
                    <li>Problems using information immediately after learning it</li>
                    <li>Missing work, school or other commitments</li>
                    <li>Trouble paying attention</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h4>Risk of violence</h4>
                <p>Most people with schizophrenia are not violent. If a person has symptoms of schizophrenia, it is important to help him or her get treatment as quickly as possible. The risk of violence is greatest when schizophrenia is untreated since the illness may get worse over time. People with schizophrenia are much more likely than those without the illness, to be harmed by others as well as harm themselves.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h4>Drugs and alcohol</h4>
                <p>It is common for people with schizophrenia to have problems with illicit drugs and alcohol. A treatment program that includes treatment for both illnesses is critical for recovery because misuse of drugs and alcohol can interfere with treatment for schizophrenia.</p>
                <p>Drug abuse can increase the risk of suicide, trauma, and homelessness in people with schizophrenia as well as increase the risk of developing other mental illnesses.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>Causes, facts and risk factors about illness</h3>
            <p>Many factors may cause schizophrenia, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Genetics:</b> Schizophrenia sometimes runs in families. However, it is important to know that just because someone in a family has schizophrenia, it does not mean that other members of the family will have it as well.</li>
                <li><b>Environment:</b> Many environmental factors may be involved, such as living in poverty, stressful surroundings, and exposure to viruses or nutritional problems before birth.</li>
                <li><b>Disruptions in brain structures, brain function, and brain chemistry:</b> These disruptions could be the result of genetic or environmental factors and, in turn, may cause schizophrenia.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Researchers have learned a lot about schizophrenia, but more research is needed to help explain its causes.</p>
            <div>
                <h4>Different forms of illness, the differences in them and how to distinguish (taken from WebMD)</h4>
                <p>Experts talk about schizophrenia as a spectrum disorder that includes all the previous subtypes. It's a group of related mental disorders that share some symptoms. They're like variations on a theme in music. They affect your sense of what's real. They change how you think, feel, and act.</p>
                <p>It's a <a href="https://www.webmd.com/schizophrenia/guide/what-is-psychosis">psychosis</a>, which means that what seems real to you isn't. You could have:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Hallucinations: Seeing or hearing things that aren't there.</li>
                    <li>Delusions: Mistaken but firmly held beliefs that are easy to prove wrong, like thinking you have superpowers, are a famous person, or people are out to get you.</li>
                    <li>Disorganized speech: Using words and sentences that don't make sense to others.</li>
                    <li>Strange behavior: Acting in an odd or repetitive way, like walking in circles or writing all the time, or sitting perfectly still and quiet for hours on end.</li>
                    <li>Withdrawn and lifeless: Showing no feelings or motivation, or lacking interest in normal daily activities.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>People with schizophrenia have at least two of these symptoms for at least 6 months. One of them must be hallucinations, delusions, or disorganized speech. A single voice that offers ongoing comments about your thoughts and actions, or voices that talk to each other, is enough.</p>
                <p>There could have been times when you didn't have any symptoms, but the first one would have started at least 6 months ago. And you must have had them for at least a month continuously.</p>
                <p>You may have different symptoms at different times, and they may get worse or better -- and it's still schizophrenia.</p>
                <p>Doctors may categorize your schizophrenia according to your main symptom to make a diagnosis clearer. But rather than saying you have "paranoid schizophrenia," they would say you have "schizophrenia with paranoia,” for example.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h4>Related Disorders</h4>
                <p>What makes schizophrenia different from some similar disorders in the spectrum is how long you've had symptoms and whether you also have signs of a <a href="https://www.webmd.com/mental-health/mood-disorders">mood disorder.</a></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Schizophreniform:</b> You've had psychotic symptoms for at least a month but less than 6 months, . Many people with this disorder go on to have schizophrenia. In other words, schizophreniform is often early schizophrenia. But for about one-third of people, the symptoms just go away.</li>
                    <li><b>Schizoaffective disorder:</b> You’ll have a combination of psychotic symptoms along with depression (major depressive disorder) or bipolar disorder. You could feel very down, or swing between super high-energy or highly irritable and very low, too. Psychotic symptoms have to sometimes happen even when your mood is OK for you to have schizoaffective disorder. This is a rare, serious, lifelong illness.</li>

            <h3>Schizoaffective disorder</h3>
            <div>
                <h4>What Is Schizoaffective Disorder?</h4>
                <p><a href="https://www.webmd.com/schizophrenia/guide/mental-health-schizoaffective-disorder">Schizoaffective disorder</a> describes a condition that includes features of both <a href="https://www.webmd.com/schizophrenia/default.htm">schizophrenia</a> and a <a href="https://www.webmd.com/mental-health/mood-disorders">mood disorder</a> (either major depressive disorder or <a href="https://www.webmd.com/bipolar-disorder/bipolar-disorder-health-check/default.htm">bipolar disorder)</a></p>
                <p>Scientists don’t know for sure if schizoaffective disorder is related mainly to schizophrenia or a mood disorder. But it’s usually viewed and treated as a hybrid, or combination of both conditions.</p>
                <p>Schizoaffective disorder can be managed, but most people diagnosed with it have relapses.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h4>Types of Schizoaffective Disorder</h4>
                <p>There are two types. Each has some schizophrenia symptoms:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Bipolar:</b> Episodes of mania and sometimes major depression</li>
                    <li><b>Depressive:</b> Only major depressive episodes</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h4>Symptoms of Schizoaffective Disorder</h4>
                <p>The symptoms may vary greatly from one person to the next and may be mild or severe. They may include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Mania</li>
                    <li>Depression</li>
                    <li>Poor appetite</li>
                    <li>Weight loss or gain</li>
                    <li>Changes in sleeping patterns (sleeping very little or a lot)</li>
                    <li>Agitation (being very restless)</li>
                    <li>Lack of energy</li>

                    <li>Guilt or self-blame</li>
                    <li>Trouble with thinking or concentration</li>
                    <li>Thoughts of death or suicide</li>
                    <li>Being more active than usual, including at work, in your social life, or sexually</li>
                    <li>Talking more or faster</li>
                    <li>Rapid or racing thoughts</li>
                    <li>Little need for sleep</li>
                    <li>Agitation</li>
                    <li>Being full of yourself</li>
                    <li>Being easily distracted</li>
                    <li>Self-destructive or dangerous behavior (such as going on spending sprees, driving recklessly, or having risky sex)</li>
                    <li>Delusions (false, sometimes strange beliefs that the person refuses to give up, even when they get the facts)</li>
                    <li>Hallucinations (sensing things that aren't real, such as hearing voices)</li>
                    <li>Disorganized thinking</li>
                    <li>Odd or unusual behavior</li>
                    <li>Slow movements or not moving at all</li>
                    <li>Lack of emotion in facial expression and speech</li>
                    <li>Poor motivation</li>
                    <li>Problems with speech and communication</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h4>Causes of Schizoaffective Disorder</h4>
                <p>Scientists don’t know the exact cause. Things that may be involved include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Genetics (heredity):</b> Someone may inherit a tendency to get schizoaffective disorder from their parents.</li>
                    <li><b>Brain structure:</b> People with schizophrenia and mood disorders might have problems with brain circuits that manage mood and thinking.</li>
                    <li><b>Environment:</b> Scientists think things like viral infections or highly stressful situations could play a part in having schizoaffective disorder in people who are at risk for it. How that happens isn’t clear.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Schizoaffective disorder usually begins in the late teen years or early adulthood, often between ages 16 and 30. It seems to happen slightly more often in women than in men. It's rare in children.</p>
                <p>Because schizoaffective disorder combines symptoms that reflect two mental illnesses, it’s easily confused with other psychotic or mood disorders. Some people may be thought to have schizophrenia, and others may be thought to have just a mood disorder. As a result, it’s hard to know how many people actually have schizoaffective disorder. It’s probably less common than either schizophrenia or mood disorders alone.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h4>Diagnosis of Schizoaffective Disorder</h4>
                <p>There are no laboratory tests to specifically diagnose schizoaffective disorder. So doctors rely on a person's medical history -- and may use various tests such as brain imaging (like MRI scans) and blood tests -- to make sure that a physical illness isn’t the reason for the symptoms.</p>
                <p>If the doctor finds no physical cause, he may refer the person to a psychiatrist or psychologist. These mental health professionals are trained to diagnose and treat mental illnesses. They use specially designed interview and assessment tools to evaluate a person for a psychotic disorder.</p>
                <p>In order to diagnose someone with schizoaffective disorder, the person must have:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Periods of uninterrupted illness</li>
                    <li>An episode of mania, major depression, or a mix of both</li>
                    <li>Symptoms of schizophrenia</li>
                    <li>At least two periods of psychotic symptoms, each lasting 2 weeks. One of the episodes must happen without depressive or manic symptoms.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>Treatments & Medications</h3>
            <p>Two main types of treatment can help with symptoms: antipsychotic medications and psychosocial treatments.</p>
            <div>
                <h4>Antipsychotic medications</h4>
                <p>Antipsychotic medications help patients with the psychotic symptoms of schizophrenia. Some people have side effects when they start taking medications, but most side effects go away after a few days. People respond to antipsychotic medications differently, so it is important to report any of these side effects to a doctor. Sometimes a person needs to try several medications before finding the right one.</p>
                <p>A patient should not stop taking a medication without first talking to a doctor. Suddenly stopping medication can be dangerous, and it can make schizophrenia symptoms worse.</p>
                <p>Choosing the right medication, medication dose, and treatment plan should be done under an expert’s care and based on an individual’s needs and medical situation. Only an expert clinician can help a patient decide whether the medication’s ability to help is worth the risk of a side effect.</p>
                <p>There are two groups of antipsychotics. Doctors call the older group of medications “first-generation,” “typical,” or “conventional” antipsychotics. Some common ones are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Chlorpromazine (Thorazine)</li>
                    <li>Fluphenazine (Prolixin)</li>
                    <li>Haloperidol (Haldol)</li>
                    <li>Perphenazine (Trilafon)</li>
                    <li>Thioridazine (Mellaril)</li>
                    <li>Thiothixene (Navane)</li>
                    <li>Trifluoperazine (Stelazine)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The newer ones are called “second-generation,” or “atypical” antipsychotics. Examples of these medicines include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Aripiprazole (Abilify)</li>
                    <li>Aripiprazole lauroxil (Aristada)</li>
                    <li>Asenapine (Saphris)</li>
                    <li>Clozapine (Clozaril)</li>
                    <li>Iloperidone (Fanapt)</li>
                    <li>Lurasidone (Latuda)</li>
                    <li>Olanzapine (Zyprexa)</li>
                    <li>Paliperidone (Invega Sustenna)</li>
                    <li>Paliperidone palmitate (Invega Trinza)</li>
                    <li>Quetiapine (Seroquel)</li>
                    <li>Risperidone (Risperdal)</li>
                    <li>Ziprasidone (Geodon)</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h4>Side Effects of Antipsychotics</h4>
                <p>While the first-generation, older meds usually cost less, they can have different side effects than the newer antipsychotics. Some can cause higher levels of the hormone prolactin. This can affect sex drive, mood, menstrual cycles, and growth of breast tissue in both men and women.</p>
                <p>One of the common side effects of many of the newer antipsychotics is weight gain. Your loved one may also have trouble keeping his blood sugar and cholesterol levels under control.</p>
                <p>One of the more serious side effects from long-term use of both the older and newer medications is a movement disorder called tardive dyskinesia. It makes your facial, tongue, and neck muscles move uncontrollably and can be permanent.</p>
                <p>While both older and newer antipsychotics can cause tardive dyskinesia, researchers believe that the odds are higher with the older antipsychotics.</p>
                <p>Antipsychotics come with other side effects as well. Your loved one could have any of the following:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Weight gain</li>
                    <li>Sexual problems</li>
                    <li>Drowsiness</li>
                    <li>Dizziness</li>
                    <li>Restlessness</li>

                <h4>Psychosocial treatments</h4>
                <p>Psychosocial treatments help patients deal with everyday challenges of schizophrenia. These treatments are often most helpful after patients find a medication that works. Examples of treatment include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Family education: Teaches the whole family how to cope with the illness and help their loved one.</li>
                    <li>Illness management skills: Helps the patient learn about schizophrenia and manage it from day to day.</li>
                    <li>Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT): Helps the patient identify current problems and how to solve them. A CBT therapist focuses on changing unhelpful patterns of thinking and behavior.</li>
                    <li>Rehabilitation: Helps with getting and keeping a job or going to school and everyday living skills.</li>
                    <li>Peer counseling: Encourages individuals to receive help from other people who are further along in their recovery from schizophrenia.</li>
                    <li>Self-help groups: Provides support from other people with the illness and their families.</li>
                    <li>Treatment for drug and alcohol misuse: Is often combined with other treatments for schizophrenia.</li>
                </ul>
                <div>
                    <h5>Coordinated Specialty Care (CSC)</h5>
                    <p>This treatment model integrates medication, psychosocial therapies, case management, family involvement, and supported education and employment services, all aimed at reducing symptoms and improving quality of life.</p>
                    <p>The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) Recovery After an Initial Schizophrenia Episode (RAISE) research project examined different aspects of CSC. The goal of RAISE was to help reduce the likelihood of long-term disability that people with schizophrenia often experience and help them lead productive, independent lives. Findings from RAISE show that CSC is more effective than usual treatment approaches. CSC is most effective when the patient receives coordinated specialty care treatment in the earliest stages of the disorder.</p>

                <div>
                    <h5>Clinical trials</h5>
                    <p>Clinical trials are research studies that look at new ways to prevent, detect, or treat diseases and conditions, including schizophrenia. During clinical trials, treatments might be new drugs or new combinations of drugs, new surgical procedures or devices, or new ways to use existing treatments.</p>
                    <p>Decisions about participating in a clinical trial should be made in collaboration with a licensed health professional.</p>
                    <p>The goal of clinical trials is to determine if a new test or treatment works and is safe. Individual participants may benefit from being part of a clinical trial. However, participants should be aware that the primary purpose of a clinical trial is to gain new scientific knowledge so that there can be better ways to prevent and treat patients in the future.</p>

            <h3>How can Family and Friends support a loved one with Schizophrenia?</h3>
                <h4>Support system</h4>
                <p>Supporting a loved one with schizophrenia can be hard. It can be difficult to know how to respond to someone who makes strange or clearly false statements. It is important to understand that schizophrenia is a biological illness.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Help them with treatment and encourage them to stay in treatment.</li>
                    <li>Remember that the beliefs or hallucinations seem very real to them.</li>
                    <li>Be respectful, gently supportive, empathetic, and kind without tolerating dangerous or inappropriate behavior.</li>
                    <li>Check to see if there are any support groups in the area.</li>

                <h4>Common Questions About Schizophrenia, Psychosis and Treatment (Taken from NIMH’s RAISE)</h4>
                <p><b>Q: What is psychosis?</b></p>
                <p>A: The word psychosis is used to describe conditions that affect the mind, where there has been some loss of contact with reality. When someone becomes ill in this way it is called a psychotic episode. During a period of psychosis, a person’s thoughts and perceptions are disturbed and the individual may have difficulty understanding what is real and what is not.  Symptoms of psychosis include delusions (false beliefs) and hallucinations (seeing or hearing things that others do not see or hear). Other symptoms include incoherent or nonsense speech, and behavior that is inappropriate for the situation. A person in a psychotic episode may also experience depression, anxiety, sleep problems, social withdrawal, lack of motivation and difficulty functioning overall.</p>
                <p><b>Q: What causes psychosis?</b></p>
                <p>A: There is not one specific cause of psychosis. Psychosis may be a symptom of a mental illness, such as schizophrenia or bipolar disorder, but there are other causes, as well. Sleep deprivation, some general medical conditions, certain prescription medications, and the abuse of alcohol or other drugs, such as marijuana, can cause psychotic symptoms. Because there are many different causes of psychosis, it is important to see a qualified healthcare professional (e.g., psychologist, psychiatrist, or trained social worker) in order to receive a thorough assessment and accurate diagnosis. A mental illness, such as schizophrenia, is typically diagnosed by excluding all of these other causes of psychosis.</p>
                <p><b>Q: How common is psychosis?</b></p>
                <p>A: Approximately 3 percent of the people in the U.S. (3 out of 100 people) will experience psychosis at some time in their lives. About 100,000 adolescents and young adults in the U.S. experience first episode psychosis each year.</p>
                <p><b>Q: What is the connection between psychosis and schizophrenia?</b></p>
                <p>A: Schizophrenia is a mental illness characterized by periods of psychosis. An individual must experience psychotic symptoms for at least six months in order to be diagnosed with schizophrenia. However, a person may experience psychosis and never be diagnosed with schizophrenia, or any other mental health condition. This is because there are many different causes of psychosis, such as sleep deprivation, general medical conditions, the use of certain prescription medications, and the abuse of alcohol or other drugs.</p>
                <p><b>Q: Do people recover from psychosis?</b></p>
                <p>A: With early diagnosis and appropriate treatment, it is possible to recover from psychosis.  Many people who receive early treatment never have another psychotic episode. For other people, recovery means the ability to live a fulfilling and productive life, even if psychotic symptoms return sometimes.</p>
                <p><b>Q: What should I do if I think someone is having a psychotic episode?</b></p>
                <p>A: If you think someone you know is experiencing psychosis, encourage the person to seek treatment as early as possible. Psychosis can be treated effectively, and early intervention increases the chance of a successful outcome. To find a qualified treatment program, contact your health care professional, or contact one of the national organizations listed on the <a href="http://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/schizophrenia/raise/raise-resources-for-patients-and-families.shtml">Patients and Families</a> page. If someone having a psychotic episode is in distress or you are concerned about their safety, consider taking them to the nearest emergency room, or calling 911.</p>
                <p><b>Q: Why is early treatment important?</b></p>
                <p>A: Left untreated, psychotic symptoms can lead to disruptions in school and work, strained family relations, and separation from friends. The longer the symptoms go untreated, the greater the risk of additional problems. These problems can include substance abuse, going to the emergency department, being admitted to the hospital, having legal trouble, or becoming homeless. Studies have shown that many people experiencing first episode psychosis in the United States typically have symptoms for more than a year before receiving treatment. It is important to reduce this <a href="https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/schizophrenia/raise/raise-questions-and-answers.shtml#6">duration of untreated psychosis</a> because people tend to do better when they receive effective treatment as early as possible.</p>
                <p><b>Q: What is coordinated specialty care (CSC)? </b></p>
                <p>A: Coordinated specialty care (CSC) is a recovery-oriented treatment program for people with first episode psychosis (FEP). CSC uses a team of specialists who work with the client to create a personal treatment plan. The specialists offer psychotherapy, medication management geared to individuals with FEP, case management, family education and support, and work or education support, depending on the individual’s needs and preferences. The client and the team work together to make treatment decisions, involving family members as much as possible. The goal is to link the individual with a CSC team as soon as possible after psychotic symptoms begin. Coordinated specialty care is a general term used to describe a certain type of treatment for FEP. There are many different programs that are considered CSC. In the United States, examples of CSC programs include (but are not limited to) NAVIGATE, the Connection Program, OnTrackNY, the Specialized Treatment Early in Psychosis (STEP) program, and the Early Assessment and Support Alliance (EASA). RAISE is not a CSC program. RAISE is the name of a research initiative developed and funded by the National Institute of Mental Health to test CSC programs. Navigate and the Connection Program were the two CSC programs tested as part of the RAISE Project.

                <p><b>Q. What is shared decision making and how does it work in early treatment?</b></p>
                <p>A: Shared decision making means individuals and their health care providers work together to find the best treatment options based on the individual’s unique needs and preferences. Clients, treatment-team members, and (when appropriate) relatives are active participants in the process.  More information about how to participate in decisions with health care providers can be found on the <a href="http://store.samhsa.gov/product/Shared-Decision-Making-in-Mental-Health-Care/SMA09-4371">SAMHSA website.</a></p>
                <p><b>Q: What is the role of medication in treatment?</b></p>
                <p>A: Antipsychotic medications help reduce psychotic symptoms. Like medications for any illness, antipsychotic drugs have benefits and risks. Individuals should talk with their health care providers about the benefits of taking antipsychotic medication as well as potential side effects, dosage, and preferences like taking a daily pill or a monthly injection.

                <p><b>Q: What is Supported Employment/Education (SEE) and why is it important?</b></p>
                <p>A: For young adults, <a href="https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/schizophrenia/raise/raise-questions-and-answers.shtml#1">psychosis</a> can hurt school attendance and academic performance or make it difficult to find or keep a job. Supported Employment/Education (SEE) is one way to help individuals return to work or school. A SEE specialist helps clients develop the skills they need to achieve school and work goals. In addition, the specialist can be a bridge between clients and educators or employers. SEE services are an important part of <a href="https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/schizophrenia/raise/raise-questions-and-answers.shtml#11">coordinated specialty care</a> and are valued by many clients. Findings from <a href="https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/schizophrenia/raise/raise-questions-and-answers.shtml#20">RAISE-IES</a> showed that SEE services often brought people into care and engaged them in treatment because it directly addressed their personal goals.</p>
