            <h2>Bipolar Disorder</h2>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>What is it?</h3>
            <p>Bipolar disorder is best described as a disorder of the energy of the brain. People with bipolar disorder experience unusual and intense changes in mood and behavior. There are often two extremes in bipolar disorder: mania and depression. During a manic episode, people feel “up,” and may be much more energetic than usual. Mania is much more extreme than a sudden burst of energy or a good mood. Manic episodes may be associated with high-risk behaviors including substance abuse, sexual promiscuity, excessive spending, and even violence. During a depressive episode, people feel “down,” have low energy, and neglect obligations.</p>
            <p>Bipolar disorder often causes problems in work, school, and relationships and may require hospitalization. The frequency of bipolar disorder ranges. The more serious form of the illness, bipolar I disorder, affects about 1 out of 100 (1%) people. Bipolar disorder with all subtypes affects about 4.5 out of 100 (4.5%) people. Bipolar disorder affects men and women equally, and typically begins in early adulthood. When bipolar disorder begins in later life, it is often a result of physical changes in the brain.</p>
            <p>Although bipolar disorder is often thought to be an adult disease, studies indicate that bipolar disorder is just as likely to appear in childhood or early adolescence. The disease may be different – and possibly even more severe – in young people.</p>
            <p>More research is needed to improve our understanding of how to diagnose and treat bipolar disorder in children and youth. Recognizing the disease in young people is especially challenging because its symptoms often appear similar to more common childhood conditions, including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), anxiety disorders, or conduct disorders. With this said, a professional evaluation and diagnosis is very important.</p>
            <p>The number of college students diagnosed with bipolar disorder has increased steadily in recent years. The onset of bipolar disorder tends to peak between the ages of 15 and 24 – just as many students are adjusting to the challenges of college. Bipolar disorder among college-age students often remains untreated, and many students may attempt to ignore or hide their symptoms due to social or academic pressures.</p>

            <h3>Symptoms</h3>
            <p>Depressive illnesses take many forms, and their symptoms combine differently in each individual. Some people with depression experience only a few symptoms, while others experience many. Severity of symptoms also varies by individual and changes over time. If you’ve had a change in your normal mood and have been experiencing at least 5 of the signs and symptoms below for more than 2 weeks most of the day, nearly every day, you may be depressed.Bipolar disorder takes many forms, and its symptoms combine differently in each individual. Some people with bipolar disorder experience only a few symptoms, while others experience many. The severity of symptoms also varies by individual and changes over time. Bipolar disorder may include depressive episodes, manic episodes, or hypomanic episodes. Sometimes the features of these episodes overlap. Doctors refer to this overlap as mixed features.</p>
            <p>Someone with bipolar disorder may experience a depressive state with mixed features (e.g. mostly depressed with some manic or hypomanic symptoms) or a manic or hypomanic state with mixed features (mostly manic or hypomanic with some depressive symptoms). For instance, if you are having a manic episode with mixed features, you will experience the elevated energy of mania along with the despair of depression.</p>

            <div>
                <h4>Manic episode</h4>
                <p>If you’ve had a change in your normal mood and have been experiencing at least 3 of the signs and symptoms below for at least 1 week for most of the day, nearly every day, you may be experiencing a manic episode. Symptoms of a manic episode include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Feeling very energized (high)</li>
                    <li>A pathological increase in activity</li>
                    <li>Poor judgment and/or reckless behavior</li>
                    <li>Extreme moodiness (up and down moods)</li>
                    <li>Trouble concentrating or paying attention (distracted)</li>

                </ul>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h4>Hypomanic episode</h4>
                <p>A hypomanic episode is very similar to a manic episode, but is less intense and shorter. A hypomanic episode is only required to last for 4 days, but still impacts a person’s functioning.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h4>What are the symptoms of bipolar disorder in young people?</h4>
                <p>Patients with bipolar disorder experience extreme variations in mood, commonly referred to as “mood swings,” ranging from episodes of depression (extreme lows) to episodes of mania (extreme highs) or hypomania (a less intense form of mania).</p>
                <p>In adults who develop the illness, mania is often characterized as someone feeling “up” or “high” and depression is generally indicated by increased sadness, inability to feel pleasure, social isolation, and changes in appetite/sleep. In youth, symptoms of mania and depression often present themselves in different ways, including:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Disruptive/aggressive behaviors</li>
                    <li>Increased irritability</li>
                    <li>Destructive outbursts</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h4>Symptoms of bipolar disorder also differ in young people based on their developmental stage.</h4>
                <p>Younger children’s symptoms may include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Physical complaints</li>
                    <li>Irritability</li>
                    <li>Crying spells</li>
                    <li>Significant difficulty with relationships</li>
                    <li>Extreme sensitivity to negative reactions from others</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Older pre-adolescents and adolescents are more likely to experience mixed symptoms and symptoms that cycle more rapidly between depressive and manic states than what is observed in adults.</p>

            <h3>Causes, facts and risk factors about illness</h3>
            <p>We do not know exactly what causes bipolar disorder. Researchers are finding out more about the disorder by studying it. This research may help doctors do a better job of treating people with bipolar disorder. It may also help doctors identify patterns of the illness in order to predict whether a person will get bipolar disorder or experience an episode.</p>
            <p>Research through the Heinz C. Prechter Bipolar Research Program at the University of Michigan Depression Center suggests that bipolar disorder has many causes. Although bipolar disorder tends to run in families, no one gene explains it. Everyone’s experience with bipolar disorder is unique. But all of these experiences include features that fall into the following 7 classes of observable characteristics or phenotypes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Disease. </b> Changes in how certain chemicals function in the brain may affect bipolar disorder.</li>
                <li><b>Neurocognitive. </b> Changes in how certain chemicals function in the brain may affect bipolar disorder.</li>
                <li><b>Temperament and personality. </b> People with bipolar disorder are frequently more reactive and “temperamental” compared to the average person.</li>
                <li><b>Motivated behaviors. </b> People with bipolar disorder frequently experience substance use disorders and other behavioral patterns.</li>

                <li><b>Life story. </b> Trauma and abuse in childhood, unfortunate life experiences and other challenges contribute to bipolar disorder in complex ways.</li>
                <li><b>Sleep and circadian patterns. </b> Patterns of sleep and circadian rhythms are often different among bipolar patients, causing disruptions in daily patterns and routines.</li>
                <li><b>Outcomes and course of illness. </b> Measures of how someone’s symptoms change over time and respond to treatment.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>Different forms and phases of illness</h3>
            <p>There are several types of bipolar disorder, based on the specific duration and pattern of manic and depressive episodes. Bipolar disorder actually refers to two different disorders – bipolar I disorder and bipolar II disorder.</p>
            <p><stong>Bipolar I:</stong> Characterized by one or more extreme manic episodes or mixed episodes. Typically a person will experience periods of depression as well.</p>
            <p><stong>Bipolar II:</stong> Characterized by episodes of hypomania and depression that may not seem as extreme as in Bipolar I or may not last as long.</p>
            <p><stong>Bipolar Disorder, unspecified:</stong> A type of bipolar disorder that does not follow a particular pattern (for example, very rapid shifts between some symptoms of mania and some symptoms of depression).</p>
            <p><stong>Cyclothymia:</stong> A milder form of bipolar disorder characterized by several hypomanic episodes and less severe episodes of depression that alternate for at least 2 years. The severity of this illness may change over time.</p>
            <p><stong>Bipolar disorder with rapid cycling:</stong> Diagnosed when a person experiences 4 or more manic, hypomanic, or depressive episodes in any 12-month period. Rapid cycling can occur with any type of bipolar disorder, and may be a temporary condition for some people.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>How is Bipolar Disorder Diagnosed?</h3>
            <p>Psychiatric evaluation by a psychiatrist or psychologist is recommended if they have read this description and feel they have these experiences along with functional impairment, or that something is distinctly different than before.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>Treatments & Medications</h3>
            <p>For most patients with bipolar disorder, ongoing treatment is required to continually monitor and adjust medications and manage symptoms.</p>
            <div>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>“Mood stabilizing”</b> medications such as lithium, certain anticonvulsant medications and antipsychotics can be effective in preventing episodes of either depression or mania. Antidepressants should be used cautiously as they may worsen the mood swings.</li>
                    <li><b>Psychotherapy</b> is used along with medications to help patients cope with stressful life experiences that can bring about episodes. Certain kinds of therapy, such as those that focus on ways that thoughts and behaviors affect mood, how relationships are affecting mood, and monitoring daily structure are thought to be the most effective kinds of psychotherapy. Learning how to recognize early warning symptoms of a relapse is a key skill for preventing relapses. However, psychotherapy can never replace medication.</li>
                    <li><b>Exercise and nutrition</b> are important lifestyle strategies for managing bipolar disorder.</li>
                    <li><b>Support</b> of family members, friends and co-workers is crucial.</li>
                </ul>

            <div>
                <h4>Advice for college students</h4>
                <p>With a good treatment plan, a strong support system, and a commitment to keeping stress in check, students can succeed in college and manage their bipolar disorder at the same time.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h4>A few tips for doing so include:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Try to establish and maintain consistent sleep habits, avoiding disruptions such as all-night study sessions</li>
                    <li>Maintain a regular and consistent schedule weekly (ex: waking up/going to bed, meals, classes, study/homework time, medication)</li>
                    <li>Get plenty of regular exercise</li>
                    <li>Eat a healthy diet</li>
                    <li>Avoid using alcohol or drugs</li>
                    <li>Develop a support system of friends, family, and campus professionals.</li>
                    <li>Keep stress in check. Practice time management skills, seek academic help when needed, and don’t hesitate to seek guidance for roommate, relationship or financial concerns</li>
                    <li>Adjust your expectations and be flexible with your goals. Recognize that attending college while managing bipolar disorder may mean it takes you longer to fulfill your academic requirements.</li>
                    <li>If you have been receiving treatment back home, make it a priority to make referral arrangements with a healthcare provider and pharmacy near campus before school starts.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h4>Psychotherapy</h4>
                <p>Psychotherapy or “talk therapy” is the treatment of psychological problems through communication between an individual and a trained mental health professional in a safe and confidential environment. Psychotherapy aims to explore and understand behaviors, beliefs, thoughts, and emotions, and to improve relationships and coping skills. Psychotherapy includes both individual or group therapy, which brings around 5 to 15 patients together each week for confidential conversation guided by a professional.</p>
                <div>
                    <h5>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy</h5>
                    <p>CBT is a well-established, evidence-based treatment approach for depression. CBT is a goal-oriented approach that helps patients recognize and modify thought and behavior patterns that interfere with functioning or make depressive symptoms worse. CBT has also been shown to result in improvement in brain functioning. People with depression often experience distorted negative thoughts about themselves or their situations (for example, characterizing their lives as worthless).</p>
                    <p>By working to reveal more accurate information about themselves, these negative thoughts can be countered with a more realistic picture of both the present and the future. As depression also tends to cause people to isolate, some of CBT often involves changing patterns of avoidance to help a person continue to move toward life aims. CBT commonly combines eight to twelve regular weekly sessions (sometimes more, sometimes less) with a trained therapist who assigns exercises that individuals can practice on their own in between sessions.</p>
                    <p>These exercises encourage individuals to practice replacing negative thoughts with more realistic ones based on past experience or to write negative thoughts in a journal. Once patients learn to recognize these automatic thinking patterns, they are taught more adaptive ways of thinking and acting to meet their aims. This typically has a beneficial impact on mood and future behaviors.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h5>Interpersonal Psychotherapy</h5>
                    <p>IPT focuses on current relationships and interactions as they are related to a person’s mood. Improvements to relationships can often lead to improvements in mood. It usually involves up to 20 weekly sessions, each lasting approximately one hour. Sessions are focused on one or two key interpersonal issues that have been identified as most closely related to a person’s depression. These issues may include disputes with others, life changes or transitions that affect relationships, or unresolved grief over the loss of a relationship.</p>

            <h3>Medications</h3>
            <div>
                <h4>Mood stabilizers</h4>
                <p>Mood stabilizers are a class of medications that have been shown to be effective in preventing both the manic and depressive episodes of bipolar disorder, and/or reducing their symptoms. Two types of medications are commonly used as mood stabilizers: lithium and atypical mood stabilizers.</p>
                <div>
                    <h5>Lithium</h5>
                    <p>The element lithium has been used as a mood stabilizer for more than 50 years. Lithium has been shown to be particularly effective in patients whose manic episodes consist mostly of elevated mood or euphoria. Lithium is also useful in treating the depressive episodes in bipolar disorder either alone or when combined with other medications.</p>
                    <p>Side effects associated with lithium:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>If dose increases are done too quickly or the dose is too high, nausea, vomiting or diarrhea</li>
                        <li>In regular use, may cause dry mouth and excessive thirst which then leads to more frequent urination</li>
                        <li>Slight hand tremors are common</li>
                        <li>When used in high doses and for many years, may cause renal (kidney) damage (seen in a small percentage of patients)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>To maximize the benefits of lithium and minimize these side effects, and to protect the thyroid and kidneys (both of which can be impacted by lithium in the bloodstream), regular blood tests are required when lithium is prescribed.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h4>Anticonvulsants</h4>
                <p>Many in this class of medications were originally used to treat seizures and so are called anticonvulsants. Some anticonvulsants turned out to be useful particularly for bipolar disorder and in some cases for depression. The main medications considered mood stabilizers include lithium, carbamazepine (Tegretol), valproic acid (Depakote), and lamotrigine (Lamictal). Side effects vary substantially depending on the medication. Most require regular blood tests to monitor the blood levels, since there is an ideal blood level for effectiveness.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h4>Antipsychotics</h4>
                <p>Antipsychotic medications were first-developed to treat psychosis, but later were found to work with mood disorders without any psychotic symptoms, but the name stayed as “antipsychotics”. In lower doses, some of them can improve mood (such as quetiapine (Seroquel) or aripiprazole (Abilify). In higher doses, they work more for psychotic symptoms like delusions or hallucinations. They may be used alone or in combination with mood stabilizers or antidepressants. Side effects vary greatly between antipsychotics, but most can cause weight gain and other metabolic problems, while some can cause serious tremors, so dosing and monitoring are essential.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <div>
                    <h4>Antidepressants</h4>
                    <p>*In some cases, antidepressants are prescribed along with a mood stabilizer if depressive symptoms aren’t relieved with other methods. Note, however, that antidepressants have the possibility of triggering a manic episode, and therefore should be taken with caution* </p>
                    <p>Antidepressants help relieve depression or anxiety by promoting changes in brain chemistry and communication between brain cells known to regulate mood. Their benefits typically outweigh the possible side effects. They are called antidepressants because research showed first that they help treat depression. Later research showed that they work in many other conditions, particularly anxiety disorders. There is a wide range of antidepressant medication available, including:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)</li>
                        <li>Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs)</li>
                        <li>Trycyclic antidepressants (TCAs)</li>
                        <li>Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs)</li>
                    </ul>

                <div>
                    <h5>Serotonin and Noradrenalin Reuptake Inhibitors (SNRIs)</h5>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Are often prescribed for severe depression and/or co-occurring conditions, as they are often slightly stronger than most SSRIs.</li>
                        <li>May be helpful if you have chronic pain in addition to depression</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Examples include, Desvenlafaxine (Pristiq, Khedezla), Duloxetine (Cymbalta), Levomilnacipran (Fetzima), Venlafaxine (Effexor XR)</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h5>Tricyclic Antidepressants (TCAs)</h5>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Are effective, but have more harmful side effects than other antidepressants</li>
                        <li>Lead to more cardiac side effects, and may be toxic in overdose</li>
                        <li>Are sometimes used in patients with treatment-resistant depression when other treatments have failed</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Examples include Desipramine (Norpramin), Imipramine (Tofranil), Nortriptyline (Pamelor), Protriptyline (Vivactil), Trimipramine (Surmontil)</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h5>Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs)</h5>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Were the first type of antidepressant developed</li>
                        <li>Are effective, but have more side effects than other antidepressants</li>
                        <li>Typically require diet restrictions because they can cause dangerously high blood pressure when taken with certain foods or medications</li>
                        <li>Are sometimes used in patients when other treatments have failed</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>MAOIs work by inhibiting the activity of enzymes called monoamine oxidase, which keep key neurotransmitters from being broken down or metabolized. MAOIs can also be used to treat panic disorder, social anxiety or agoraphobia. Examples include Isocarboxazid (Marplan), Phenelzine (Nardil), Selegiline (Emsam), Tranylcypromine (Parnate)</p>
                    <p>Note: In some cases, people taking antidepressants may experience an increase in suicidal thoughts or behavior, especially in the first few weeks after starting or when the dose is changed.</p>
