            <h2>Anxiety</h2>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>What is it?</h3>
            <p>Anxiety occurs when thought patterns are disturbed in a variety of ways, including obsessive thinking, excessive worrying, experiencing fear of a specific thing or event, and stress that is out of proportion to the impact of the event.</p>
            <p>Anxiety that is connected with a single stressful situation or event is normal and may even help you focus on a task or stop doing something that may be dangerous. However, an anxiety disorder is characterized by unproductive anxiety that is persistent, unconnected to a specific event, and impacts someone’s quality of life and ability to function normally.</p>
            <p>Many people with anxiety experience more than one type of anxiety disorder at the same time, and they may experience anxiety in combination with other disorders such as depression or substance abuse. In fact, it is estimated that depression and anxiety overlap in 75% of people that have an anxiety disorder.</p>
            <p>About 40 in 100 women and 26 in 100 of men will experience clinical anxiety at some point in their lifetime. Anxiety disorders are highly treatable, yet only about one-third of those suffering receive treatment.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>Symptoms</h3>
            <p>Each anxiety condition has its own set of features, and anxiety symptoms combine differently in each individual. Some common symptoms of all anxiety disorders include:</p>
            <uL>
                <li>Physical: panic attacks, sweating, nausea, racing heart, tightening of the chest, quick breathing, restlessness, and/or feeling tense</li>
                <li>Psychological: excessive fear, worry, dissociation, depersonalization, and/or obsessive/rapid thoughts</li>
                <li>Behavioral: avoidance of situations that make you feel anxious</li>
            </uL>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>Causes, facts and risk factors about illness</h3>
            <p>Although the exact causes are unclear, scientists believe that several factors, alone or in combination, may contribute to the development of an anxiety disorder. As is the case with depression, inherited characteristics, brain chemistry, and environmental factors such as stressful life events may all play a role in bringing about an episode of anxiety.</p>
            <div>
                <h4>Personal Factors</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Personality – People with low self-esteem, perfectionists, shy, or inhibited are more likely to develop anxiety.</li>
                    <li>Drug and alcohol use – People with anxiety may turn to drugs and alcohol to manage their symptoms. However, this may lead to a substance use problem. Substance use can actually make anxiety symptoms worse when the effects of the substance wear off.</li>
                    <li>Family history– People with a close relative who has anxiety may be at an increased genetic risk to develop anxiety.</li>
                    <li>Physical health problems – The worry and stress of dealing with a serious illness such as asthma can lead to anxiety.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h4>Life Circumstances</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Long-term difficulties- </b> Ongoing stress caused by issues such as a stressful relationship or work stress can lead to depression over time.</li>
                    <li><b>Life events- </b>Stressful times or events such as getting divorced or losing your job, or even positive changes like getting married, may trigger depression in people who are already at risk.</li>
                    <li><b>Trauma or grief- </b>Physical or emotional abuse or grief after the death of a loved one can trigger depression in people who are already at risk. Stressful childhood experiences such as abuse, neglect, or witnessing domestic violence are common and have a strong influence on many health and social problems, including depression, anxiety, and risk of suicide.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>Different forms and phases of illness</h3>
            <p>There are 6 most common types of anxiety:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)</li>
                <li>Social Anxiety Disorder</li>
                <li>Specific Phobia</li>
                <li>Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD)</li>
                <li>Panic Disorder</li>
                <li>Post-Traumatic Stress/Acute Stress Disorder</li>
            </ul>
            <div>
                <h4>What is Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)?</h4>
                <p>Unlike other anxiety disorders, the anxiety experienced in GAD is not limited to specific situations or circumstances. Rather, the focus of worry and repetitive thinking is on many or most areas of a person’s life (e.g., academic or job performance, finances, social relationships, crime, etc.).</p>
                <p>People with GAD find it very difficult or impossible to control their worry.</p>
                <p>GAD anxiety lasts for six months or longer and is associated with at least three of these symptoms:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Feeling restless or on-edge</li>
                    <li>Feeling easily tired or fatigued</li>
                    <li>Having difficulty concentrating</li>
                    <li>Irritability</li>
                    <li>Tenseness in muscles</li>
                    <li>Difficulty sleeping</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h4>What is Social Anxiety Disorder?</h4>
                <p>People with social anxiety disorder have a strong and persistent fear of being judged by other people or humiliating themselves in social situations such as:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Speaking or performing a task in front of others</li>
                    <li>Eating in front of others</li>
                    <li>Meeting new people</li>
                    <li>Attending parties or gatherings</li>
                </ul>
                <p>People with social anxiety disorder have severe anxiety (or even panic) whenever they find themselves in situations where they fear they will be judged negatively by others.</p>
                <p>People with social anxiety disorder typically go to great lengths to avoid these activities or situations (e.g., completely avoiding classes that involve public speaking).</p>
                <p>Social anxiety disorder causes problems with school, work, and social relationships</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h4>What are Specific Phobias?</h4>
                <p>Specific phobias (often referred to simply as phobias) are disorders in which individuals have an excessive fear of a specific object, animal or situation.</p>
                <p>People with specific phobias experience intense fear (sometimes full-blown panic) nearly every time they come in contact or anticipate coming in contact with the feared object or situation.</p>
                <p>People with phobias often make great efforts to avoid the feared object or situation (e.g., someone with a dog phobia will avoid walking down streets where they may encounter a dog). This avoidance can greatly interfere with activities.</p>
                <p>Phobias typically fall into one of the following categories:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Animal Type. Involves fear of animals (e.g., snakes or insects)</li>
                    <li>Natural Environment Type. Involves fear of natural environmental objects or situations (e.g., heights, bodies of water, or storms)</li>
                    <li>Blood-Injection-Injury Type. Involves fear of seeing blood, receiving an injection or other medical procedure</li>
                    <li>Situational Type. Involves fears of everyday situations (e.g., tunnels, bridges, flying, driving, closed places, etc.)</li>
                    <li>Other Type. Involves fear of situations not covered in the other categories (e.g., choking or vomiting)</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h4>What is Panic Disorder?</h4>
                <p>People who suffer from panic disorder have sudden, unexpected, anxiety attacks (or panic attacks) that involve at least four of the following symptoms:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Heart palpitations or rapid heart beat</li>
                    <li>Intense sweating</li>
                    <li>Trembling or shaking</li>
                    <li>Shortness of breath</li>
                    <li>Feelings of choking</li>
                    <li>Chest pain or discomfort</li>
                    <li>Feelings of nausea</li>
                    <li>Feeling dizzy or faint</li>
                    <li>Feeling detached from your body or feeling that things around you seem unreal</li>
                    <li>Feeling that you are losing control or going crazy</li>
                    <li>Fear of dying</li>
                    <li>Numbness or tingling in limbs</li>
                    <li>Chills or hot flashes</li>
                </ul>
                <p>A panic attack may feel like a heart attack. They tend to develop abruptly, usually peak within 10 minutes, and end within 20 to 30 minutes. Panic attacks often occur at unpredictable times and with no obvious trigger.</p>
                <p>After a panic attack, people with panic disorder have intense worry that they will have another attack. Sometimes this worry is so intense that people suffering from panic disorder will avoid places or situations where it would be difficult to escape or get help if they had another panic attack (e.g., crowded stores or classrooms). This is called agoraphobia.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h4>What is Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and Acute Stress Disorder (ASD)?</h4>
                <p>PTSD and ASD are anxiety conditions that occur after someone experiences or witnesses a traumatic event in which their life or safety (or the life or safety of someone else) is perceived as being threatened. The symptoms of ASD overlap with those for PTSD. However, while an ASD diagnosis can be given in the first month following a trauma, a PTSD diagnosis cannot be given until symptoms have lasted for at least one month. Most people recover from initial symptoms of trauma naturally with time. People who continue to experience symptoms for at least one month and at a level that interferes with daily life may be diagnosed with PTSD.</p>
                <p>Events that commonly lead to trauma include, but are not limited to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Seeing someone killed or badly injured, or seeing someone close to you in mortal danger</li>
                    <li>Being in an accident that could have led to death</li>
                    <li>Being a victim of rape or sexual assault</li>
                </ul>
                <div>
                    <h5>There are 3 main features of PTSD and ASD:</h5>
                    <div>
                        <h6>Re-experiencing the traumatic event</h6>

                            <li>Repeatedly having dreams about the event</li>
                            <li>Repeatedly feeling or acting as though you are reliving the event (sometimes taking the form or flashbacks or hallucinations)</li>
                            <li>Feeling great emotional distress or physical agitation when something reminds you of the traumatic event</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <h6>Avoiding things or situations that remind you of the trauma, along with feelings of emotional numbness</h6>

                            <li>Trying to avoid thoughts, feelings, conversations, activities, people, or places that remind you of the trauma</li>
                            <li>Difficulty remembering important parts or events that took place during the trauma</li>
                            <li>Feeling less interest in activities you normally enjoy</li>
                            <li>Feeling detached from others</li>

                    </div>
                    <div>

            <h3>How is Anxiety diagnosed?</h3>
            <p>You may start by seeing your primary care provider to find out if your anxiety could be related to your physical health. He or she can check for signs of an underlying medical condition that may need treatment.</p>
            <p>However, you may need to see a mental health specialist if you have severe anxiety. A psychiatrist is a medical doctor who specializes in diagnosing and treating mental health conditions. A psychologist and certain other mental health professionals can diagnose anxiety and provide counseling (psychotherapy).</p>
            <p>To help diagnose an anxiety disorder, your mental health provider may:</p>
            <div>
                <ul>
                    <li>Give you a psychological evaluation. This involves discussing your thoughts, feelings and behavior to help pinpoint a diagnosis and check for related complications. Anxiety disorders often occur along with other mental health problems — such as depression or substance misuse — which can make diagnosis more challenging.</li>
                    <li>Compare your symptoms to the criteria in the DSM-5. Many doctors use the criteria in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), published by the American Psychiatric Association, to diagnose an anxiety disorder.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        <div>
            <h3>Lifestyle Tips/Wellness to Deal With Anxiety</h3>
            <div>
                <p>Exercise</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Exercising will help relieve stress and aid in excessive thinking</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p>Meditation/Mindfulness</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Meditating is a great tool that can be developed in order to help one control their mind and help combat anxious thoughts and understand their root causes.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p>Socializing</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>It is easy to become very introvertive when one is experiencing crippling anxiety symptoms. Socializing is an absolute must, even if it is just with your family. Engage in conversations and try your hardest to not let the anxieties force you to live a different life than you did before.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>Treatments</h3>
            <div>
                <h4>Psychotherapy</h4>
                <p>Also known as talk therapy or psychological counseling, psychotherapy involves working with a therapist to reduce your anxiety symptoms. It can be an effective treatment for anxiety. In therapy, you learn how to recognize and change negative thoughts about yourself and develop skills to help you gain confidence in social situations.</p>
                <p>Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is the most effective form of psychotherapy for anxiety disorders, and it can be equally effective when conducted individually or in groups. Generally a short-term treatment, CBT focuses on teaching you specific skills to improve your symptoms and gradually return to the activities you've avoided because of anxiety.</p>
                <p>CBT includes exposure therapy, in which you gradually work up to facing the situations you fear most. This can improve your coping skills and help you develop the confidence to deal with anxiety-inducing situations. You may also participate in skills training or role-playing to practice your social skills and gain comfort and confidence relating to others. Practicing exposures to social situations is particularly helpful to challenge your worries.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h4>Self-Help and CAM</h4>
                <p>For those who seek alternatives to traditional medicine or would like to supplement their treatment, self-help and complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) may be useful.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Self-Help:</b> Many self-help books and materials (DVDs, CDs) are available. Before investing in these, consider the background and credentials of the author or producer, as well as the credibility of the publisher. Ask your mental health care or primary care provider for recommendations, check reputable websites, or consult trusted family and friends.</li>
                    <li><b>Exercise:</b> When you pick up the pace physically, your body releases endorphins, which are hormones that can improve your mood. Activities that require concentration, such as catching a ball or following an aerobics routine, also keep your brain occupied. Replacing negative thoughts with neutral or positive ones can help calm you down. And exercise may increase confidence and personal satisfaction as you begin to accomplish your goals and overcome challenges.</li>
                    <li><b>Diet and Nutrition:</b> Some research suggests an association between nutrient deficiencies and different manifestations of anxiety. For example, zinc deficiency may have a relationship to panic disorder and OCD. Other deficiencies that may contribute to anxiety are magnesium and vitamins D, B6, and B12. Your doctor will likely order a blood test if a deficiency is suspected.</li>

                        <ul>
                            <li>The nutrients L-theanine and tryptophan may help decrease anxiety if added to your diet. Ongoing research seeks to determine whether vitamin E, omega 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, glycine, and inositol supplements could have protective or other anti-anxiety benefits.</li>
                            <li>Many consider mindfulness a subcategory of meditation. It keeps your thoughts focused on the present moment, even if they wander. For example, you might notice muscle tension in your shoulders, then the sound of the clock ticking and the pattern of your breathing. In practicing mindfulness, it's important that you recognize your own experiences without casting judgment.</li>

                    </li>
                    <li><b>Relaxation Techniques:</b> Many methods help people relax, including guided imagery (listening to a script to visualize calm environments) and breathing exercises for slowing the heart rate and focusing thoughts. Another method, progressive muscle relaxation, involves tensing and releasing different muscle groups throughout the body. During this process, note positive sensations and decreased stress with every release. Other relaxation techniques include massage, tai chi, yoga, reiki or other healing touch therapies, and music and art therapy or similar creative outlets.</li>
                    <li><b>Herbal Supplements:</b> Scientific research on herbal supplements as anxiety treatments has been limited and inconclusive. Using supplements as a complementary or alternative treatment must be done with great caution. Before taking any herbal supplement, discuss it with your doctor to minimize the chance of an adverse drug interaction or side effect.</li>

                            <li>Of supplements marketed for anxiety, chamomile and kava have shown some promise. Studies of passionflower have shown mixed results or were tested only in small groups of people. No studies have reported benefits of using St. John's Wort to treat anxiety. In fact, if you have been prescribed an SSRI or SNRI, adding St. John's Wort can cause a potentially life-threatening condition known as serotonin syndrome. The research on lavender oil, lemongrass, bacopa monnieri, and other herbs is ongoing; there simply is not enough information to know whether they can treat anxiety, work better than a placebo, and most importantly, if they are safe to use at all.</li>

            <h3>Medications</h3>
            <p>Several types of medications are used to help relieve symptoms, depending on the type of anxiety disorder you have and whether you also have other mental or physical health issues. For example:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Certain antidepressants are also used to treat anxiety disorders.</li>
                <li>An anti-anxiety medication called buspirone may be prescribed.</li>
                <li>In limited circumstances, your doctor may prescribe other types of medications, such as sedatives, also called benzodiazepines, or beta blockers. These medications are for short-term relief of anxiety symptoms and are not intended to be used long term.</li>
            </ul>
            <div>
                <h4>SSRIs and SNRIs:</h4>
                <p>These two classes were initially prescribed as antidepressants but, more recently, research has found that they might help with anxiety as well. They were named based on how they work in the brain: selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs). To understand these, some terms need to be defined. First, a neurotransmitter is like a messenger or a runner in a relay race; when an impulse affects a nerve fiber, that fiber then releases a substance (i.e., the neurotransmitter) that will transfer the message to the next stop along the path, which ultimately leads to a muscle, gland, or other target cell.</p>
                <p>Serotonin is a chemical that acts as a neurotransmitter, carrying signals along and between nerves—and it also plays a role in mood regulation, which is helpful for someone with anxiety. SSRIs block certain nerve cells in the brain from reabsorption, or reuptake, which leaves more serotonin available. SSRIs include fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, sertraline, citalopram, paroxetine, and escitalopram. Brand names associated with SSRIs include Paxil, Prozac, and Zoloft. SSRIs may be used to treat post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), panic disorder, social anxiety disorder (SAD), and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).</p>
                <p>SNRIs increase the levels of serotonin and norepinephrine (a chemical also known as a stress hormone) by inhibiting their reabsorption into brain cells. SNRIs include venlafaxine, milnacipran, desvenlafaxine, levomilnacipran, and duloxetine. Cymbalta and Effexor are examples of SNRI brand names. A physician may prescribe SNRIs for patients with GAD, SAD, or panic disorder.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Benzodiazepines:</b> These drugs work on the GABA (gamma-amino butyric acid) neurotransmitter, which plays numerous roles related to sleep, relaxation, anxiety, mood changes, and memory. Although benzodiazepines are typically fast-acting, they also tend to be habit-forming, so doctors usually try other medications first, especially in their patients with a history of addiction. Among the benzodiazepines that may be prescribed for the treatment of anxiety are lorazepam, clonazepam, and diazepam. Some of the brand names are Xanax, Librium, Valium, and Ativan. Individuals who suffer from panic disorder, SAD, or GAD may be prescribed benzodiazepines as part of their treatment plan.</li>
                    <li><b>Beta Blockers:</b> This class of drugs blocks the binding of epinephrine (also known as the hormone adrenaline) and norepinephrine to nerve receptors. Typically used to treat cardiac conditions, beta blockers like atenolol and propranolol may be prescribed to a patient with social anxiety disorder specifically in performance situations, such as speaking in public, rather than as a long-term treatment. Brand name beta blockers include Inderal, Tenormin, and Lopressor. Beta blockers are usually only used to treat infrequent, performance-related episodes of social anxiety.</li>
                    <li><b>Off-Label and Other Drugs:</b> A physician may prescribe other types of medications, such as a tricyclic antidepressant (imipramine); a monoamine oxidase inhibitor, or MAO inhibitor; an anxiolytic (buspirone); or others that work via different mechanisms, such as mirtazapine. Currently, ketamine is receiving increased scholarly interest as a potential treatment for depression and anxiety; the FDA gave it priority status as a treatment for depression, and some physicians have been using it as an off-label treatment for anxiety.</li>

            <h3>What to do in case of emergency</h3>
            <p>First, note that if you are someone with anxiety, note that any symptoms you may be having that are scaring you are most likely created by your anxiety. Do not be alarmed, and start to manage your breathing. Take deep breaths in, count to three, and release. Hyperventilating is a symptom of an anxiety attack, and excessive hyperventilation can cause tingling sensations in the body which may be frightening. This is due to a lack of oxygen. Try and find your happy place, it is wise for any anxious person to have a few go-to “happy places” they can imagine whenever they are in a high stress situation to remove sidetrack their thought process and give themselves space. Finally, if your symptoms persist there are anxiety hotlines such as the crisis text line (text CONNECT to 741741) or call 911. Dispatchers are used to calming people down in high stress situations and can get you the help you need.</p>
